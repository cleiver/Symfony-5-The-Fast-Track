This repository contains the application developed throughout the book [Symfony 5: The Fast Track](https://leanpub.com/symfony5-the-fast-track), which I had the pleasure of be a member in the translation team ðŸ™‹.

The application consists of an old and good guestbook, but in this case, tailored for conferences. But even with such a simple project, we made use of lots of cool stuff ðŸ¤“, such as:
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/)
- Testing with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)
- SPA with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- Internalization
